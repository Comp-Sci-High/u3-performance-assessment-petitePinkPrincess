## Why did I pick this API topic? 
Because I was thinking about NYC when I was doing the planning page. 

## Describe my API and the available data enpoints 
My API gives you three landmarks per borough in NYC. 
/ goes to the home page. 
/docs goes to the documentation of my API. 
/ plus borough name gets you all three landmarks in that one specific borough. (example /bronx)
/ plus borough and then / plus the # of that landmark gets you that specific landmark. (example /bronx/1)

## How was my experience building my own API server afrer using other APIs as a client in Unit 2? 
Literally how did those API coder make their website looks cute like there is no way they make the whole style sheet and CSS within that little <> like I can't see anything.
